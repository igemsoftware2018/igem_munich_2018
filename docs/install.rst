To be able to install sequ-into on your Mac OS system, first make sure you have all support packages.

====
Support Package Installation:
====

1. Anaconda

* Download the installation package here: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.3.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
* Open your terminal window (for example by typing "terminal" in the spotlight search field) and enter the following: ``bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-5.3.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh``
* The installer prompts “In order to continue the installation process, please review the license agreement.” Click ``Enter`` to view license terms.
* Scroll to the bottom of the license terms and enter ``yes`` to agree to them.
* The installer prompts you to press ``Enter`` to confirm the location. It may take a few minutes to complete.  We recommend you accept the default install location and press ``Enter``.
* The installer prompts “Do you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda install location to PATH in your /home/<user>/.bash_profile ?” We recommend ``yes``.
* The installer finishes and displays “Thank you for installing Anaconda!”
* The installer describes Microsoft VS Code and asks if you would like to install VS Code. Enter yes or no. You don't need Microsoft VS Code to use sequ-into!
